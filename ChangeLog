1998-12-07  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtkcontainers.defs (gtk_viewport_new): Accept NULL
	arguments for adjustments of a viewport.  This is the correct
	fix for Michael's other patch.

	* examples/*/*.py: got rid of deprecation messages.  Put scrolled
	windows round all clists.
	
	* pyglade/build.py: Fixes a bug in scrolledwindow_new pointed out
	by Michael Hudson.  Also made some changes so that it doesn't use
	any deprecated functions.

	* gtkmodule.c: fixed two typos pointed out by Michael Hudson

1998-12-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtkmodule.c, generate/*.defs, gtk.py: updated to latest CVS.  This
	includes the function name changes Tim Janik introduced.  I have
	added backward compatibility wrappers for the old functions in gtk.py,
	which also print out a deprecation message.

1998-12-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtk.py (GtkLayout): I had left a few remnants from when this class
	was in gnome.ui.  This is now fixed.

1998-11-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* description.py: Added a description of the GtkCTreeNode type.

	* gtk.py (GtkCTree): Added the GtkCTree class to this layer.
	Hopefully I haven't made any mistakes.

1998-11-28  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtklists.defs: added entries for GtkCTree.

	* gtkmodule.c: Added the GtkCTreeNode type.  It exports some of the
	attributes of the GtkCTreeRow associated with the node.  Specifically,
	the parent, next sibling links, and a list of children.  This should
	be enough attributes to make the type useful.
	Also added extra functions for GtkCTree.
	
1998-11-27  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtk*.defs: updated for GTK+-1.1.5.
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added the PyGtk_RegisterBoxed function, exported through
	the _private dictionary.  This allows adding extra boxed types so they
	will be recognised in signal handlers and the like.
	
	* gtk.py: this file used to be Gtkinter.py.  People should make this
	change in their programs.  Also updated for changes to the API.
	
	* Gtkinter.py: new file.  Simply does a "from gtk import *", so old
	programs will still run properly.

	* examples/*/*.py, pyglade/*.py, GdkImlib.py, GtkExtra.py: changed
	occurences of Gtkinter to gtk.

1998-11-17  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* GdkImlib.py: missed a closing parenthesis.  This caused problems.
	
	* generate/gtk.defs(gtk_rc_add_*_style): removed these functions.
	They weren't exported by Gtkinter, and their declaration has changed
	in newer GTK+'s.  Now pygtk should compile with both GTK+-1.1.3 and
	CVS GTK (tested for a 1998-11-16 checkout).
	
	* configure.in, NEWS: bumped version up to 0.5.5, and made new release.
	
	* generate/gtkmisc.defs, Gtkinter.py: added the GtkCalendar widget.

1998-11-15  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added GdkCursor type.
	
	* gtkmodule.c(GdkWindow.set_cursor): function to set cursor for window
	
	* generate/gtk.defs (gtk_cursor_*): new functions to create cursors
	
	* gtkmodule.c(gtk_pixmap_create_from_xpm_d): new function to create
	a GdkPixmap from a list of strings (XPM data).  This allows you to
	store pixmaps inline with your program for distribution.
	
	* gdkimlibmodule.c: export the GdkImlibImageType, and a _private
	dictionary that holds exported functions.  I should be able to
	add the GdkImlibImage dependent functions to _gnomeui now.
	
	* GDK.py, GTK.py: updated with new constants.
	
	* examples/simple/*1.py: stopped importing _gtkbase, and don't call
	_gtk.pygtk_init().
	
	* pyglade/build.py: added menu widgets to the interface building code.
	
	* pygtk.spec: new file -- an RPM spec file for this package.
	
	* NEWS: add information about this new version.

1998-11-15  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added GdkAtom handling.  There is now a special type for
	GdkAtoms that can be cast to string and int with str() and int()
	respectively, and it supports coercions, so it should act like an
	int in most cases.  Functions that take GdkAtom's as arguments
	actually take ints, so backward compatibility is kept, but functions
	that return GdkAtoms now return this special type.
	
	* gtkmodule.c, generate/gtkdnd.defs, Gtkinter.py: added the new DnD
	code, and support for selections.  The gtk_selection_* functions have
	been mapped to GtkWidget.selection_*, and the gtk_drag_* functions
	have been mapped to GtkWidget.drag_*
	
	* GdkImlib.py: added function create_image_from_data, so you can
	create an image from raw RGB data.  Also added the Image.get_pixmap
	method, which is like Image.make_pixmap, except it returns the
	GdkPixmap,GdkBitmap pair, instead of a GtkPixmap widget.

1998-11-14  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/*.defs: changes to bring pygtk up to date with GTK+-1.1.3

1998-11-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added wrappers for GdkDragContext and GtkSelectionData.
	Also removed all the old DnD GdkEvent mappings, and added the
	GdkEventDND mapping.  This should be enough to get the new Dnd signals
	working.
	
	* generate/gtkbase.defs, gtkmodule.c(_wrap_gtk_widget_dnd_*): removed
	the old gtk_widget_dnd_* functions from the bindings.

1998-11-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* build system: Converted over to using automake.  Note thay some
	modifications have been made to the original version of automake,
	so you will need to apply my patches if you want to modify pygtk.
	
	* swigsrc/*: removed.  I am now using some code generation tools
	that take .defs files as input.
	
	* gdkimlibmodule.c: got rid of all the swig stuff, and cleaned up the
	code a bit.  This has reduced the source code size by half.

1998-11-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* ChangeLog: started change log.  Old Changelog file has been moved
	to NEWS
	
	* NEWS: used to be Changelog
