1999-02-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtk.py (create_pixmap_from_xpm,create_pixmap_from_xpm_d): altered
	these functions to use the gdk_pixmap_colormap_create variants if
	the first argument is a GtkWidget or GtkStyle.  This means you
	don't have to realise the widget before creating pixmaps from it.
	(GtkCheckMenuItem.set_state, GtkToggleButton.set_state): removed
	these compatibility routines so they don't mask GtkWidget.set_state.

	* gtkmodule.c: moved gtk_item_factory_get_widget here so I can catch
	NULL returns and convert them to None returns.  Also added the
	depth attribute to GdkWindow objects.
	Also added gdk_pixmap_colormap_create_* variants.  These can be used
	if you only have a colormap reference, rather than a window.

	* GtkExtra.py: there were a couple of calls to
	GtkContainer.border_width which is deprecated.

	* examples/testgtk/testgtk.py: fixes to dnd code in this example.  I
	hadn't looked at it since Owen made the dnd changes.

	* examples/simple/tooltip2.py: fixed small bug pointed out by Markus
	Oberhumer.

	* pyglade/build.py (clist_new): fixes to make it parse after clist
	changes.

1999-02-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtklists.defs, gtk.py: added GtkCList.focus_row.
	
	* _gdkimlibmodule.c, GdkImlib.py: added push_visual and pop_visual,
	that can be used to easily set GTK to use the imlib visual/colormap
	combination.

	* gtkmodule.c: the PyObject -> GtkArg conversion routines were not
	catching some exceptions that they generated.  This would cause
	wierd problems if you passed the wrong argument types to signal
	handlers.  This was found by Chi-Deok Hwang <cdhwang@sr.hei.co.kr>

	* examples/simple/dnd.py, examples/simple/dndpixmaps.py: and example
	of drag and drop contributed by Chi-Deok Hwang <cdhwang@sr.hei.co.kr>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added gtk_ctree_get_selection, that returns nodes
	rather than pointers.

	* gtk.py: made changes to reflect those below.  Also added
	GtkWidget.get_colormap() (it was missing previously).

	* generate/gtkedit.defs (gtk_spin_button_update): added function.

	* generate/gtkmenus.defs (gtk_check_menu_item_set_active): function
	renaming.
	(gtk_menu_set_title): added function.

	* generate/gtkmisc.defs (gtk_toggle_button_[sg]et_active): added
	functions, and removed gtk_toggle_button_set_state.

1999-01-27  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtkmodule.c: fixed some typos in _wrap_gtk_ctree_get_row_data and
	_wrap_gtk_ctree_base_nodes.  This fix was sent to me by Jim
	Robinson <robinson@ipsg.mot.com>.

1999-01-26  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtk.py: fixed typo in GtkProgress.configure.

1999-01-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gdkimlibmodule.c: (_wrap_gdk_imlib_create_image_from_data): function
	would raise an exception if there was a null in the data or alpha
	arguments.  Also added some sanity checks on the lengths of data
	and alpha.  This patch was submitted by Toby D. Reeves.

1999-01-21  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* examples/testgtk/testgtk.py (create_scrolled_windows): changed
	a call to GtkContainer.add to GtkScrolledWindow.add_with_viewport.

	* gtk.py (GtkPacker.add): Added defaults for the arguments.

1999-01-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtk.py (GtkProgress.get_current_percentage): fixed function call

	* gtk.py (GtkScrolledWindow): changed so it inherits from GtkBin
	instead of GtkContainer, to match changes in GTK.

	* GDK.py (DRAG_PROTO_ROOTWIN): Added the constant.

	* gtkmodule.c: forgot to include GTK_TYPE_DOUBLE in one of the GtkArg
	processing routines.  Also fixed a problem for events with a NULL
	window.

1998-12-24  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gdkimlibmodule.c(_wrap_gdk_imlib_get_rgb_height): I accidentally
	returned rgb_width instead of rgb_height.  This bug report was from
	Osamu Tanimoto <tanimoto@rios.co.jp>.

1998-12-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* GtkExtra.py: modified the signal connect bit in the MenuFactory
	code so it is a bit more sane.

1998-12-21  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* pygtk.spec: updated version here as well.

	* README: updated required GTK version to 1.1.9

	* configure.in: Updated version for pygtk to 0.5.9, increased
	GTK version check to 1.1.9.

1998-12-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtkmodule.c, generate/gtkmisc.defs: moved gtk_preview_draw_row here
	because python's string conversion routines do not like nuls in a
	string, but you quite often want them in image data.

1998-12-17  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* examples/*/*.py: changed calls to GtkLabel.set to GtkLabel.set_text.
	
	* gtk.py: made changes to reflect those below.

	* generate/gtkbase.defs (gtk_widget_set_app_paintable): added this
	stub.

	* generate/gtkmisc.defs (gtk_label_set_text): renamed gtk_label_set to
	this, added gtk_label_set_line_wrap.

	* generate/gtkdnd.defs: Added gtk_drag_source_unset.

	* generate/gtklists.defs: moved reordering function stubs from ctree
	to clist.

	* generate/gtkcontainers.defs: removed GtkDrawWindow.  Added
	gtk_paned_pack[12]

	* GtkExtra.py (MenuFactory.create): wasn't passing extra arguments
	onto signal connect.  Bug fix from Sam Tannous <stannous@cisco.com>

	* gtkmodule.c: Applied some fixes to the ctree code from
	A.Hartgers@phys.tue.nl

1998-12-09  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtk.py, generate/gtkmisc.defs, GTK.py: Added
	gtk_toolbar_set_space_style and the required enum.

1998-12-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtkmodule.c: fixed up the toolbar functions, so they also use
	gtk_signal_connect_full, and now return the added child, like
	the C functions do.

	* examples/testgtk/testgtk.py: fixed up some stuff in the main
	function and clist test.

	* gtk.py, generate/gtkcontainers.defs: added
	gtk_window_set_transient_for and gtk_window_set_default_size.

	* gtkmodule.c: Changed to use _full functions instead of _interp
	functions.  Also made gtk_signal_connect and friends use the
	gtk_signal_connect_full function rather than the default marshaller
	method.

1998-12-07  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtkcontainers.defs (gtk_viewport_new): Accept NULL
	arguments for adjustments of a viewport.  This is the correct
	fix for Michael's other patch.

	* examples/*/*.py: got rid of deprecation messages.  Put scrolled
	windows round all clists.
	
	* pyglade/build.py: Fixes a bug in scrolledwindow_new pointed out
	by Michael Hudson.  Also made some changes so that it doesn't use
	any deprecated functions.

	* gtkmodule.c: fixed two typos pointed out by Michael Hudson

1998-12-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtkmodule.c, generate/*.defs, gtk.py: updated to latest CVS.  This
	includes the function name changes Tim Janik introduced.  I have
	added backward compatibility wrappers for the old functions in gtk.py,
	which also print out a deprecation message.

1998-12-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtk.py (GtkLayout): I had left a few remnants from when this class
	was in gnome.ui.  This is now fixed.

1998-11-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* description.py: Added a description of the GtkCTreeNode type.

	* gtk.py (GtkCTree): Added the GtkCTree class to this layer.
	Hopefully I haven't made any mistakes.

1998-11-28  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtklists.defs: added entries for GtkCTree.

	* gtkmodule.c: Added the GtkCTreeNode type.  It exports some of the
	attributes of the GtkCTreeRow associated with the node.  Specifically,
	the parent, next sibling links, and a list of children.  This should
	be enough attributes to make the type useful.
	Also added extra functions for GtkCTree.
	
1998-11-27  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/gtk*.defs: updated for GTK+-1.1.5.
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added the PyGtk_RegisterBoxed function, exported through
	the _private dictionary.  This allows adding extra boxed types so they
	will be recognised in signal handlers and the like.
	
	* gtk.py: this file used to be Gtkinter.py.  People should make this
	change in their programs.  Also updated for changes to the API.
	
	* Gtkinter.py: new file.  Simply does a "from gtk import *", so old
	programs will still run properly.

	* examples/*/*.py, pyglade/*.py, GdkImlib.py, GtkExtra.py: changed
	occurences of Gtkinter to gtk.

1998-11-17  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* GdkImlib.py: missed a closing parenthesis.  This caused problems.
	
	* generate/gtk.defs(gtk_rc_add_*_style): removed these functions.
	They weren't exported by Gtkinter, and their declaration has changed
	in newer GTK+'s.  Now pygtk should compile with both GTK+-1.1.3 and
	CVS GTK (tested for a 1998-11-16 checkout).
	
	* configure.in, NEWS: bumped version up to 0.5.5, and made new release.
	
	* generate/gtkmisc.defs, Gtkinter.py: added the GtkCalendar widget.

1998-11-15  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added GdkCursor type.
	
	* gtkmodule.c(GdkWindow.set_cursor): function to set cursor for window
	
	* generate/gtk.defs (gtk_cursor_*): new functions to create cursors
	
	* gtkmodule.c(gtk_pixmap_create_from_xpm_d): new function to create
	a GdkPixmap from a list of strings (XPM data).  This allows you to
	store pixmaps inline with your program for distribution.
	
	* gdkimlibmodule.c: export the GdkImlibImageType, and a _private
	dictionary that holds exported functions.  I should be able to
	add the GdkImlibImage dependent functions to _gnomeui now.
	
	* GDK.py, GTK.py: updated with new constants.
	
	* examples/simple/*1.py: stopped importing _gtkbase, and don't call
	_gtk.pygtk_init().
	
	* pyglade/build.py: added menu widgets to the interface building code.
	
	* pygtk.spec: new file -- an RPM spec file for this package.
	
	* NEWS: add information about this new version.

1998-11-15  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added GdkAtom handling.  There is now a special type for
	GdkAtoms that can be cast to string and int with str() and int()
	respectively, and it supports coercions, so it should act like an
	int in most cases.  Functions that take GdkAtom's as arguments
	actually take ints, so backward compatibility is kept, but functions
	that return GdkAtoms now return this special type.
	
	* gtkmodule.c, generate/gtkdnd.defs, Gtkinter.py: added the new DnD
	code, and support for selections.  The gtk_selection_* functions have
	been mapped to GtkWidget.selection_*, and the gtk_drag_* functions
	have been mapped to GtkWidget.drag_*
	
	* GdkImlib.py: added function create_image_from_data, so you can
	create an image from raw RGB data.  Also added the Image.get_pixmap
	method, which is like Image.make_pixmap, except it returns the
	GdkPixmap,GdkBitmap pair, instead of a GtkPixmap widget.

1998-11-14  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* generate/*.defs: changes to bring pygtk up to date with GTK+-1.1.3

1998-11-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* gtkmodule.c: added wrappers for GdkDragContext and GtkSelectionData.
	Also removed all the old DnD GdkEvent mappings, and added the
	GdkEventDND mapping.  This should be enough to get the new Dnd signals
	working.
	
	* generate/gtkbase.defs, gtkmodule.c(_wrap_gtk_widget_dnd_*): removed
	the old gtk_widget_dnd_* functions from the bindings.

1998-11-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* build system: Converted over to using automake.  Note thay some
	modifications have been made to the original version of automake,
	so you will need to apply my patches if you want to modify pygtk.
	
	* swigsrc/*: removed.  I am now using some code generation tools
	that take .defs files as input.
	
	* gdkimlibmodule.c: got rid of all the swig stuff, and cleaned up the
	code a bit.  This has reduced the source code size by half.

1998-11-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	
	* ChangeLog: started change log.  Old Changelog file has been moved
	to NEWS
	
	* NEWS: used to be Changelog
