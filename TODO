Things to do for the gtk 2.0 based release

- fix up threading to work with GObject/GSignal/GClosure.  See the
  THREADS file for more info on what is required.

- Add GInterface support to the code generator and the rest of pygtk.

  Additions to the .defs format:
    * a definition for interfaces, something like:
       (interface TextModel
         (in-module Gtk)
         (parent Interface (G)) ;; is this needed? Can you derive interfaces?
         (c-name GtkTextModel)
       )
    * add a flag for the (object ...) sections like:
       (conforms-to GtkTextModel)

  For the code generator:
    * Create new ExtensionClasses for the interface (an empty `mixin' class).
    * Use multiple inheritance to add these methods for classes that implement
      the interface.

- Implement a new PyGtkTreeModel GObject type that can be the base for
  new tree models defined in Python.  Need to look at how the
  GtkTreeIter->tree_node lifetime is handled, as it doesn't look like
  anything is called to let us know that that data should be unrefed.

- Maybe switch all the boxed types to ExtensionClasses?
    * Maybe not such a great idea, as it doesn't make sense to subclass
      most of them.

- Add the rest of the new boxed types.
