Things to do for the gtk 2.0 based release

- fix up threading to work with GObject/GSignal/GClosure.  See the
  THREADS file for more info on what is required.

- Implement a new PyGtkTreeModel GObject type that can be the base for
  new tree models defined in Python.  Need to look at how the
  GtkTreeIter->tree_node lifetime is handled, as it doesn't look like
  anything is called to let us know that that data should be unrefed.

- Make python subclasses of GObjects into new types in the GType
  system.  Should be possible to do from GObject.__class_init__ and a
  bit of extra magic.

  Maybe stop adding get_type() class methods, and switch over to
  adding __gtype__ class attributes.  This is easier when defining new
  GObject types (ie. just set an attribute), but may mean calling
  get_type() for all classes.  Could do some special code so that the
  __gtype__ attributes are of a special type that calls the get_type()
  macro to convert to an int.
